* **Set up an RPA team with well-defined roles and responsibilities.**
	Identify an RPA sponsor, change manager, solution architects, developers, infrastructure and service support to take on key roles in the RPA CoE. The team needs to understand how to work well together – and with stakeholders – to deploy automation technology, adhere to standard processes and procedures, and measure business metrics and performance goals, including return on investment and customer satisfaction.
* **Establish an RPA CoE Council.**
	The RPA CoE Council is essentially a steering committee that provides overall governance and direction. It should meet regularly and include key representatives from the business, IT, Finance, audit, RPA CoE and others who will ensure the outcomes of RPA initiatives are in line with the objectives and expectations of executive management. The CoE Council should focus on driving RPA adoption across business units to create economies of scale and into the design and performance of the organization.
* **Establish an effective governance model.**
	As RPA deployment expands across an enterprise, the RPA CoE likely will face challenges related to cross-departmental collaboration. This requires a governance framework that determines participation and interaction among different departments and establishes protocols and prioritization for managing and sharing knowledge. The governance structure also should create a framework for developing and applying best practices to each stage of an RPA implementation.
* **Proactively manage organizational change.**
	Effective change management lays the groundwork for the successful transfer of work from humans to robots and is an essential but often overlooked part of the implementation process. The main challenge with RPA is that the change comes much faster than with traditional automation deployment – so the CoE needs to help drive operational planning, organizational redesign and before/after work process disposition.
* **Collaborate with IT.**
	As the RPA footprint expands across business units, IT support becomes increasingly important. The CoE should engage IT functions, including infrastructure, service/support, security and compliance. Many CoEs name an “IT liaison” to work directly with the CoE team to coordinate automation development so IT is in synch with security and compliance needs and to help resolve IT issues that may arise.

# 6 Steps to Creating an RPA Center of Excellence
It's important to follow these six steps to help ensure the success of your CoE:
* **Build some robots first:**
	Before you even establish your CoE, it’s important to learn the technology first. Your organization probably doesn’t have much RPA experience and may be confused by unrealistic claims made by some solutions out there. Gaining the right experience will enable more informed choices and set up your CoE for success.
* **Focus your CoE on business outcomes:**
	Automation must support your overall strategy, and intelligent process automation involves leveraging a variety of technologies, such as BPM, robotics, analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Instead of focusing on a specific technology, organize your CoE around important organizational objectives or business outcomes.
* **Build business and end user support:**
	Getting stakeholder support is fundamental. Connect your CoE to business needs, executives who support it, and the operational teams critical to its success. Remember to evangelize early and often with key stakeholders.
* **Define your operation model:**
	Will your CoE take a centralized or decentralized, federated approach? While both have their pros and cons, many organizations are leaning toward a federated approach. In this setting, it’s important to have a simplified design environment to support robots built by business analysts instead of programmers. However you define your CoE model, it is critical to standardize testing and deployment across multiple business units.
* **Identify quick wins:** An advantage of RPA is its potential to improve process performance quickly. The ability to apply RPA surgically can accelerate time to value and provide great return on investment in a specific department versus a corporate-wide project that may require buy-in across many departments in the organization.
* **Establish governance:**
	Creating a governance process is its own unique challenge within the CoE. Remain agile, build robots quickly, and repeat based on lessons learned
